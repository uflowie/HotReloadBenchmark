### What is this?
This is an attempt at a quantitative comparison of Hot Reload functionality across different SPA frontend frameworks. We aim to provide a fair comparison across the most common types of edits, such as adding or modifying components, markup, classes and logic. Each framework is benchmarked on a small application that includes standard CRUD functionality and libraries, such as state management, HTTP calls and component libraries.
